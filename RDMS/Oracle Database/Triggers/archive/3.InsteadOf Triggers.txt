Instead of Trigger
===================

the above operations cannot be operated directly on the view, coz it has some analytical operations.instead of using update, 
we can apply triggers 'instead of' triggers . for example

instead_of_trg.sql. 
Now you are saying, instead of update the view 'HR_EMPS_BY_DEPT' , directly update on the employees table, where with the new department_id

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER UPD_EMPS_BY_DEPT 
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON HR_EMPS_BY_DEPT 
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees
    SET department_id = :new.department_id
    WHERE last_name = :old.last_name;
END;
/

Now run the hr_emps_by_dept_vw.sql and check HR_EMPS_BY_DEPT view. all the relvant record last_name = 'Grant' has been updated with department_id = 10
