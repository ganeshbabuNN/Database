Instead of Trigger
===================

the above operations cannot be operated directly on the view, coz it has some analytical operations.instead of using update, 
we can apply triggers 'instead of' triggers . for example


Now you are saying, instead of update the view 'HR_EMPS_BY_DEPT' , directly update on the employees table, where with the new department_id

Trigger_InsteadOfTrigger_@View.sql

Now run the hr_emps_by_dept_vw.sql and check HR_EMPS_BY_DEPT view. all the relvant record last_name = 'Grant' has been updated with department_id = 10
