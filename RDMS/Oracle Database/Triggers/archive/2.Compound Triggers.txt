It is possible to have triggers on views, if you find it requires some special triggers where for the joins,aggreates...etc.
consider the example on HR schema.

hr_emps_by_dept_vw.sql
This allows to get the count of employess by department_id and create a view for this aggreations.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hr_emps_by_dept
AS
  SELECT first_name, 
         last_name, 
         department_id, 
         count(*) over (partition by department_id) dept_cnt
    FROM employees;

Apply the trigger @View 
-----------------------

In this view, we find for the record last_name='Grant' has null department_id, let us modify update the dept_id  using update statement

hr_emps_by_dept_vw.sql

UPDATE hr_emps_by_dept
  SET department_id = 10
  WHERE first_name = 'Kimberely';
